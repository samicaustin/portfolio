# a coding log for my own sanity
## january 12th: studio block used to set this site up!
> accomplished:
- boilerplate of basic html/css site
- tried and failed to rip the point of obsidian (automatic MD) out to use it as an ide--now on vscode where i belong
- decided against using php to embed partial templates because it is too close to my job--we're going FULL neopets style here and focusing on the power of semantic html to Keep it Simple!
