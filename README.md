# a coding log for my own sanity
## january 12th: studio block used to set this site up!
### host updates
- purchased (ugh) SSL credentials for the domain
- tried to figure out how to connect evolving repo to domain, but still not sure! might be a one-time import style situation in namecheap's cPanel interface once I'm happy with the local version

### code updates
- boilerplate of basic html/css site
- tried and failed to rip the point of obsidian (automatic MD) out to use it as an ide--now on vscode where i belong
- decided against using php to embed partial templates because it is too close to my job--we're going FULL neopets style here and focusing on the power of semantic html to Keep it Simple!
